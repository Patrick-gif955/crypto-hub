CryptoHub

CryptoHub is a simple and elegant front-end website built with HTML and CSS.
It represents a concept of a cryptocurrency dashboard with linked pages for navigation between the home, login, and signup sections.

About the Project

This project focuses on designing a clean and responsive interface using only front-end technologies.
